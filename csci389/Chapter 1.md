Cybersecurity is the protection of information that is stored, transmitted, and processed in a networked system of computers, other digital devices, and network devices and transmission lines, including the Internet. Protection encompasses confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability. Methods of protection include organizational policies and procedures, as well as technical means such as encryption and secure communications protocols.

- Information security: This term refers to preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation, and reliability can also be involved.
    
- Network security: This term refers to protection of networks and their service from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure, and provision of assurance that the network performs its critical functions correctly and there are no harmful side effects.

The cybersecurity definition introduces three key objectives that are at the heart of information and network security:

- Confidentiality: This term covers two related concepts:
    
    - – Data1 confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
        
    - – Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.
        
- Integrity: This term covers two related concepts:
    
    - – Data integrity: Assures that data (both stored and in transmitted packets) and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner. This concept also encompasses data authenticity, which means that a digital object is indeed what it claims to be or what it is claimed to be, and nonrepudiation, which is assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender’s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information.
        
    - – System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.
        
- Availability: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.

These three concepts form what is often referred to as the CIA triad.
- Expanded upon in the NIST standard FIPS 199 (Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems)

Although the use of the CIA triad to define security objectives is well established, some in the security field feel that additional concepts are needed to present a complete picture (Figure 1.1). Two of the most commonly mentioned are as follows:

- Authenticity: The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator. This means verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source.
    
- Accountability: The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an achievable goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party. Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.

OSI - Open Systems Interconnection

The OSI security architecture focuses on security attacks, mechanisms, and services. These can be defined briefly as:

- Security attack: Any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.
    
- Security mechanism: A process (or a device incorporating such a process) that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
    
- Security service: A processing or communication service that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organization. The services are intended to counter security attacks, and they make use of one or more security mechanisms to provide the service.
    

In the literature, the terms _threat_ and _attack_ are commonly used, with the following meanings:

- Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.
    
- Attack: Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.

A passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. An active attack attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.

Primary tool to counter passive attack is encryption.

Active attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation of a false stream and can be subdivided into four categories: replay, masquerade, modification of messages, and denial of service.

# Trust and Trustworthiness
Trust (MAYE95) - the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the truster, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party.

Three related concepts are relevant to a trust model:

- Trustworthiness: A characteristic of an entity that reflects the degree to which that entity is deserving of trust.
    
- Propensity to trust: A tendency to be willing to trust others across a broad spectrum of situations and trust targets. This suggests that every individual has some baseline level of trust that will influence the person’s willingness to rely on the words and actions of others.
    
- Risk: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of 1) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and 2) the likelihood of occurrence.
