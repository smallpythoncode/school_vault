It is okay to use the contents of this book to learn about how cryptography works and how it is usually broken. It is also okay to go further and read about more crypto vulnerabilities and discuss them. In fact, it is even okay to try and break something new. But please do not try to implement your own cryptographic code based on anything you read here. If there is one takeaway from this book itâ€™s this: it requires extreme discipline, precision, knowledge, expertise and professional training to write secure cryptographic code. This book only aims to organize the available knowledge in specific areas and does not compensate for the rest of those qualities. A close analogy would be the books on surgery, which do serve to organize that body of knowledge but no one in their right mind would feel that reading some medical text equips them to be a surgeon on their own.
