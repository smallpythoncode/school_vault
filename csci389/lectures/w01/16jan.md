Are the tests for the online students at a fixed time? Can we not take them on our own time?
- He later posted an announcement saying we'll have a window from Thursday through Saturday to take exams

 Different applications require different cryptographic methods
 - each has their own strengths, weaknesses, policies

Training is a significant portion of cyber security
- Humans are a weakness
	- It's up to humans to implement policies and procedures
	- Humans may choose to ignore security practices
		- Bypassing out of convenience

No security implementation is perfect
- you can approach perfect, but it is a game of cat and mouse
- Original system likely has weakness, but even patches can create new vulnerabilities

Essential Information and Network Security Objectives
1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
4. Accountability
5. Authenticity

- All portions must be in sufficient balance
	- Bolstering, say, Integrity will not compensate for Confidentiality

Information Security
- The preservation of CIA of information
- Additionally, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved

Network Security
- The protection of networks and their service from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure, and provision of assurance that the network performs its critical function correctly and there are no harmful side effects

Key terms
- Threat (intent)
- Attack (action)
- Vulnerability (the weakness in a system available for exploitation)

Kerckhoff's Principle
- a cryptosystem should be secure even in an attacker knows everything about the system except the key
	- This is how you can explain the technical details of a system but still keep it secure
	- For general software, you would never show the source code
	- For security software, you must show the source code so that those auditing, considering, and reviewing the software knows it's secure
