No meaningful notes. This whole lecture was good information, but that information is good for hands-on use. Re-watch this when doing the assignments (if necessary), or just look at the slides.

# Primes
Fundamental information. Good primer to the maths of cyber-security, but the elementary exercises in this chapter play nearly no part if effective application today.
