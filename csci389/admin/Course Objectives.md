The instruction of this course aims to expose students with the cryptographic foundation for network security. Two major cryptographic schemes will be covered, which are the symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptosystems. These two major cryptosystems have been used as the foundation for various network security protections. This course discusses fundamental concepts in the following areas:

- Cryptography background and concepts.
- The underlying algorithm used for encryption and decryption: hash functions, public/private key encryption, and block ciphers.
- Security Issues and attack on real-world Systems, the potential vulnerabilities of the encryption algorithm.
- Public key infrastructures.
- Key exchange, key management, and policy management.
- Use of encryption algorithms for authentication and information integrity.
- A few representative security protocols which are designed based on cryptography.
