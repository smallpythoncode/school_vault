[Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) was a very important computer scientist who made numerous contributions to the field. He was a proponent of structured programming and wrote a famous letter to the editor called "Go To Statement Considered Harmful." Your assignment is to read and re-read this paper (attached) to understand why, in his words, the go to statement is considered harmful to the progress of a process. Summarize in a document and post to Blackboard why Dijkstra says the Go To statement prevents recreating the progress of the process.
