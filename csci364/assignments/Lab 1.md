`Submitted 14 Jan`

Most of you are juniors or seniors. You will be asked to introduce yourself many times in the near future. Introduce yourself to me in three paragraphs.

- Paragraph 1. Give your present status as a student at the University of North Dakota.
- Paragraph 2. Describe some aspect of your experience at UND that has been meaningful. Did you receive an academic award? Were you active in the ACM club? Did you participate in a professor’s research project? Was there a previous course or assignment that you liked? 
- Paragraph 3. Write about what is ahead for you. Are you looking for an internship? A job/career? Are you applying to graduate school?  Is there something you are anticipating after this semester or once you complete your degree?

Hello. I'm Kenneth Jahnke. Most people call me Jahnke (like "yankee" but with a J), or simply Jay. I'm an online student.

  

**Paragraph 1.** I'm taking primarily 300-level classes this year, so I reckon within the CS program I'm considered a junior. Although, I have a ridiculous amount of credits for a junior. What would be the classification of a student who's accomplished 180 credits? Is that a mega senior? Why so many, you ask? Long story short - this is my second time going through college. A bunch of credits carried over but were for a differernt academic field.

  

**Paragraph 2.** As cheesy as this sounds, the journey is the most meaningful aspect of my UND career so far. I've always liked computers. I became a fairly decent self-taught programmer before enrolling in school. After a while, I assessed I was beginning to plateau on what I was learning on my own, which is why I enrolled. The more classes I'm taking, the less I'm feeling like a capable amateur and more as someone who has deep understanding of computers, programming, and cyber security.

  

**Paragraph 3.** I'm full-time military. Earning a respectable retirement from that is the primary plan and the mark is only a few years away. Aside from learning more about computers for my enhanced understanding, having a degree gives me options for later in life. Maybe an opportunity will come about to commission. Maybe the military or I will reach a point where I just want to step away and find a civilian job. Maybe I'll meet some dude who has this really great idea for a mobile app, bro, and he'll pay me six figures to program it for him.
