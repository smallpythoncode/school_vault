Comments:

**ryanstutorials.net** is well written. You can tell the person behind this site has teaching experience.

**devhints.io** helps you expand beyond what is presented at ryanstutorials. The cheatsheet format lets you see examples of different bash features, but there is no explanation of how or why you might use those features.

Most of what I know of C++ came from **learncpp.com**. An experienced programmer can jump to individual topics.

I use the reference section of **cplusplus.com** to see what functions are in different libraries.
