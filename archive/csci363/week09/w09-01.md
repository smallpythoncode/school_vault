# Survey Instruments
## Keys to success
- clear goals in advance
- development of focused items that help attain the goals

User interface is also important in surveys
- format must be such that the goal is clear

Generally a good idea: get background information on the user
- age
- background
- education in specific area
- computer knowledge
- early or late adopter of solution
- role

Don't tell the users a survey will take 5-10 minutes if it will likely take over an hour
- unprofessional
- don't waste people's time

Provide a space for general comments

Don't use paper unless you have to
- cost
- waste
- difficulty of processing
	- time involved
	- will likely be transferred to digital anyway, so might as well be borne digitally

- okay, doesn't work apparently

Mobile Phone Usability Questionnaire (MPUQ)

# Acceptance Test
For large implementation projects, the customer or manager usually sets objective and measurable goals for hardware and/or software performance


- time to learn
- task performance speed
- rate of errors
- subjective user satisfaction
- human retention of commands over time

each of the above must have a threshold for acceptance (say, 85%)

Acceptance usually starts at some local  or regional level before national or international distribution

# Evaluation during active use and beyond
successful active use requires constant attention from dedicated managers, user-services personnel, and maintenance staff
- MS - "an error occurred, would you like to report this?"
	- although, MS probably doesn't even ask for consent on this

`Lotus 1-2-3`
- why did this die?
- MS thought of themselves as more than an OS provider
- they thought they should be platform for other services
- IBM dev'd lotus
- MS wanted to provide services, lotus was left behind w/ Excel

Perfection is not attainable, but percentage improvements are possible

Must provide an avenue by which users can provide feedback
- email list
- discord
- forum
