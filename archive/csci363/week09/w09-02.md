Direct Manipulation
- the steps and feedback of steps within the interface that have real-world effects
- users
	- should immediately see whether their actions (w/in the interface) are furthering their goals and, if the actions are counterproductive, they can simply change the direction of their activity
		- prompt the user if they really want to permanently delete a file

Allow for variances in user familiarity level
- if you are going to enable advanced features for "power users", don't have the implementation of those features be at the expense of novice-user usability

Navigation within the application/solution is important
- steps should follow a logical flow
- if you're going "back", go back to the previous step
	- don't go to some random or only slightly related place

what is a metaphor w/in direct manipulation?
- the file may have the same index, but the file path may have changed
	- such is a metaphor
	- the file is still there, just how to get there has changed
- the shorter the distance, the stronger the metaphor is
	- if one click takes you to a very different (or deep) part of the app, it is a strong metaphor
