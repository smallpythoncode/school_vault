`Design of interface systems`

# Organizational Support for Design
Focus on usability engineering
- user experience (UX) teams

Teams are allowed a set amount of creativity
- be creative, sure, but it must be managed to meet a goal

# Design Process
Rosson and Carrol (scenario-based)
- iterative process

`see slides`

Functional requirement --> code shall be written
Non-f. --> not necessarily code
- "-ilities"
	- Security, scalability, usability
	- There is no specific piece of code that implements these thing,
	- they are abstractions
web search "software system non functional requirements" (NFRs)

## Preliminary and Detailed Design
Phase 2
- map what modules will be needed and how they will interact w/ each other
- then design each module
	- modularity
- if a module is complex enough, consider breaking that into separate modules


## Evaluation
Phase 4
`when he evaluates our project, he will try to break it`
- is the UX enjoyable?

# Design Frameworks
User-centered design (UCD)
Participatory design (PD)
Agile interaction design
- only apply as much of a principle as you need to you
- continual refinement to the point of necessity
