# Design Methods
- ideation and creativity
- surveys, interviews, and focus groups
- ethnographic observation
- scenario development and storyboarding
- prototyping (simulation)
	- the project

Divergence
- exploring features to include
Convergence
- eliminating things that will not be in the final prototype
Each with the intent of best completing the customer's vision

# Ethnographic Observation
## Preparation
- understand the organization policies and work culture
- familiarize yourself w/ the system and its history
- set initial goals and prepare questions
- gain access and permission to observe/interview
- Essentially, understanding the users' needs based off of what they need to do and what the current system provides
## Field Study
- establish rapport w/ managers and users
- observe/interview users in their workspace and collect subjective/objective quantitative/qualitative data
- follow any leads that emerge from the visits
- A culture check

## Analysis
- compile the collected data in numerical, textual, and multimedia databases
- quantify data and compile stats.
	- error rates, etc.
- reduce and interpret data
- refine the goals and the process uses
	- reduce the error rate by X%
	- proposal on how to do this

## Reporting
- consider multiple audiences and goals
- prepare a report and present the findings

# Prototyping
- the project will be a medium- to high- fidelity prototype
- medium implies use of some tool
	- UML
	- Visual Studio w/ C#
