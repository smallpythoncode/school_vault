This class focuses on a model driven process

Because of the cost of development, we want to develop efficient processes

process - methodology
- distinction is granular

incremental delivery
- develop one part after another
- incremental delivery
	- helps with feedback

try to keep things as they are without any major changes
- don't know effects of fundamental changes
- API breaks
- piss of your users

Advantages to incremental development
- can deliver one module and receive feedback
	- a prototype
- this can continue as long as needed
- reduces risk of project failure

# Software Engineering Principles
"guidelines"

## Seven + 1 important principles

1. Rigor and formality
	1. creative activity, however
	2. it must be systematic
	3. evaluated by mathematical laws
		1. TCAS-2 is an example (aviation)
	4. mathematical:formal analysis::systematic:rigorous evaluation
2. Separation of concerns
	1. When you're doing a task, do that task
		1. don't wander into other areas when it's not the time to do it or not even your job right now
	2. separate the issues
		1. "divide & conquer" (divide et impera)
	3. Supports parallelization of efforts and separation of responsibilities
	4. This applies to both phases and modules
	5. Keep requirements separate
		1. functionality
		2. performance
		3. user interface and usability
3. Modularity
	1. "the mother of all the other principles"
	2. The decomposition of a larger problems into smaller, developmental problems
	3. ideally, in one module you ignore the details of other modules
	4. Cohesion and coupling
		1. each module should be high cohesive
			1. understandable as a meaningful unit
		2. should exhibit low coupling
			1. reduced number of interactions w/ others
4. Abstraction
	1. identify the important aspects of a phenomenon and ignore its detail
		1. hmmmmm...
		2. oh! details like the format of a date string
			1. the format doesn't matter
				1. can be changed at any time
			2. what's important is that correct date/time is fed

These will be covered in the next lecture
5. Anticipation of Change
6. Generality
7. Incrementality
8. Reuse
