# Class Diagram

Requirements level
- a description of the problem
- not a model of the solution
- Don't use functions and specific data types
- Anything in the class diagram must be things the computer knows

Class diagram identifies the things a use will interact with
- model represents real-world concepts
- We underlay some theoretical foundation

We are dealing with discrete units

## prog 1
Don't go crazy on the methods
- Where does the method exist for a student selecting a class on Campus Connection?
	- It could go anywhere
	- CSCI 463
- In other words, don't include methods
- DO NOT USE METHODs
	- the interface has not functionaltiy
- NO DATA TYPES

Dont use the word "system" or "application"
- call it "controller" or 'control_node'
- Otherwise it is self referencing

## what we never do with the use case model?
- don't use "extend", "include"

## don't worry about private, protected
- the only thing that can change an attribute of the class is a method w/in the class
- no method from outside can change
- don't worry about private, protected in a model driven approach
