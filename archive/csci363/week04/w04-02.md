# The Project
- only one submission per team
- I as the team lead will submit

## Project Details
- Select either mobile or desktop application
- WiFi and cell service accessible
	- We won't build this, but we need to indicate this accessibility
- If desktop, we don't need to indicate standard mobile service features
	- This must be specified!
- geo-fencing - the region in which the vehicle must stay
- The system will demonstrate how the system will respond to commands
	- lock/unlock doors, etc


!! Just show how GPS tracking, cell service, etc will be implemented!!
- Do not write these systems!

This specification is not complete and will necessitate comms. w/ the contractor (Grant)

## The Textbook
- deals with how to build the user interfaces
- "usability"
- Do not make decisions for the customer
	- Verify with the customer that this is what they want


We do not need to worry about the physical hardware installed on the car
We are concerned about the app

## Platform
- Build to ONE
- iOS or Android
- Whatever is conducive with C#/Visual Studio
