# Universal Usability
Chapter 2

Ultimate goal
- addressing the needs of the users/customer
- Great code that does not meet the needs of the user is a failing product

`www.raisingthefloor.net`
- Promotes the universal usability of services
- Are your users disabled? Color blind?
	- Seeks to address these
- Social inequity should not totally remove certain users from certain services

`anthropometry`
- what dis?

There is no average user
- either compromises must be made or multiple versions of a system must be created
- Screen brightness preferences vary by user

Considerations for variances of the user population
- Vision
	- Color blindness, total blindness, contrast/brightness preferences, motion sensitivity
- Touch
	- Keyboards, knobs, pressure
- Hearing
	- audio clues must be distinct
	- hearing impaired
	- totally deaf

ANSI/HFES 100-2007
- Human Factors Engineering of Computer Workstations
- The standard on how to lend consideration to users with specific conditions or prohibitive use scenarios
- Considerations
	- Posture
	- Leg clearance at workstations
	- work-surface width, height, and depth
- Special and standard ergonomics, basically

Diverse cognitive and perceptual abilities
- Journal: Ergonomics Abstracts
	- long-term and semantic memory
	- short-term and working memory
	- Reasoning
	- Comprehension and learning aptitude
	- Fatigue
	- Effective communication
		- Direct
		- How will users interpret the tone of the instructions/documentation?
			- Quick user guide vs. technical document
		- Depth
			- Are all use case scenarios covered?
	- Perceptual (mental) load/endurance
	- Monotony/boredom
	- Nutrition/diet
	- sleep
	- Mood
		- fear, anxiety

Personality differences
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
	- these is a best guess, not conclusive
- There is no set taxonomy for identifying user personality types
- What does this have to do with UI?
	- Various responses to different stimuli
	- Various emotional responses
	- Different intuition/comprehension levels
	- NASA will tailor equipment/services to an individual anthropometry

Cultural/international diversity
- date/time formats
- characters, numerals
- left-to-right vs right-to-left reading
- weights, measures
- titles
- greetings, etiquette, tone, formality, metaphors
