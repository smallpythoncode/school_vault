Guidelines
- specific guidance
- Do xyz
- low-level

Principles
- Separation of concern
- Compare design alternatives
- mid-level

Theories
- high-level
- The science behind what we do
- somewhat nebulous
- can help determine what bias is injected into the initial phases of development
	- clean slate tailored towards customer desires

## Guidelines
- shared language to promote consistency among multiple designers in terminology, usage, appearance, and action sequences
- base on best practices
- provides a consistent development framework

- one goal of guidelines: reliability
	- other areas, such as physics, are bound by natural laws
	- here, can be broken, but will that sacrifice reliability
- Driven by who is your target user group
### Mobile Human Computer Interface (HCI) design constraints/guidelines
- Constraints
	- smaller screen size
	- touch data entry can cause errors
	- battery-power limitations
		- power to screen is a drain
	- network speed
- guidelines
	- spatial consistency
	- minimize number of steps
	- minimize data entry
		- don't want to finger what should be typed
	- focus on goals and optimize tasks

- what tasks users are willing to do on a device is at least somewhat dependent on the method of interaction (touch vs. keyboard) and the size of the screen
	- This is why variable size devices are being showcased

### Getting the user's attention
- intensity
- marking
- size
- font choice
- blinking
- color
- audio
- notifications/pop-ups

Use these only when necessary
- we don't aneurysms
- Can be annoying if done is excess



## Principles

### Organizing the display
Smith and Mozier (1986) high-level goals:
1. consistency of data display
	- both as not repeating information on different pages and consistent layout between pages
2. Efficient information assimilation by the user
3. minimal memory load on the user
	- what's the point of your system of it doesn't to the brunt work?
4. compatibility of data display w/ data entry
5. flexibility for user control of data display
