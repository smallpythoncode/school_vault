assignment1
- DO IT THE EASY WAY!!!
	- if there is a drag and drop feature, USE IT

# principles

Reuse
- assignment 2 will build off of assignment 1

Accidental reuse vs intentional reuse

model-driven software engineering
- a flow chart of what goes where and does what
- then implement in the code

C# has tools to build the framework for this, just need to customize the details

process model
- flow chart what happens in what order and under what conditions

When are we going to be assigned partners?
- are we going to be assigned partners soon enough to do anything effectively?

# Object Oriented Principles

What is our system, what does it do, and who is using it?
- From our library check-out system, we could modify parts of the code to make a POS system (potentially)

If you're building a POS system, you may need data from the tax agency system, but you don't need to know how the tax agency system works
- know what you need to know, get what you need to get, ignore everything else
- separation of concern
