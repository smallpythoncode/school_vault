He hasn't created the fucking teams yet

VPOS
- vocal expression

- organization
- support and elaboration

team score
- individual score
	- if a team of 4 and all did 25%, each will receive the same grade proportion
	- a sheet will identify who did what percentage
	- if a difference in the breakdown
		- the highest percentage will get the project score
		- the others will get a proportional score based on the percentages
		- Example: if A did 60% and B did 40%
			- the overall score is 90%
			- A gets 100% of 90%, so 90%
			- B did 2/3 of what A did, so 60%
	- "the motivation" is so every member does as much as they can?

The last lecture is Nov 11

Kalman Filter
- some Elon Musk nerd shit
- slide 2 is supposed to a representation of this
	- 2 types: a process model and a measurement model

What the point of all that shit?
-> Keep it as simple as possible

All the classes are members of a set
- duplicates of classes makes it no longer a set
	- this would make a bag
- to be a set, all must be unique
- ordered sequence is an set w/in an order

Slide 4 is a cheat sheet on how to identify what is and is not a set
- this will need to be fixed by Grant

if it is not unique, it could a property of a unique class
- must be relevant

(what the fuck does any of this mean?)

A user of a library system
- relevant, yes
- unique, yes

A user is the highest level of abstraction
- subs are students, staff, and teachers

books are not unique
- multiple copies of the same book

Librarians came up w/ descriptions to make them unique
- title, author, publisher, date
- the description has unique identifier
	- a serial number

for a book store (books are not kept so not serialized), they would add a count to the description
