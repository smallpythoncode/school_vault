Who the fuck is on our teams?
- he will only respond to team lead? WTF?
- Oh, he doesn't want his inbox filled? Then make it separate assignments

He will assign team members on Friday

===============

Classes (OOP)
- representation of real-life object

Why did we take discrete maths?
- classes are sets
	- collection of similar items
	- we can uniquely identify each member of the set

On diagrams, classes are represented as rectangular boxes
1. name
2. features owned by the class
3. methods of the class


UML - Unified modeling languages
- taken from the best parts of a mix of other languages

Types of connections between classes
1. Association
2. Aggregation
	1. class B is a part of class A if the empty (white) diamond is on a
	2. The whole (A) is the sum of its parts (B)
3. Composition
	1. "Strong aggregation"
	2. part B in aggregation can be used in more than one type of class A
	3. filled (black) diamond means the parts cannot be shared
	4. !!! black diamonds are rarely needed
		1. think twice about using it
		2. subset of aggregation
4. Generalization
	1. Class B is a subset of Class A
		1. A savings class is a subclass of a bank account
	2. italics means abstraction
		1. not an object intended to be used
		2. will "exist" in the form of subclasses
		3. bank account method will exist in class, but the checking account and savings account will have actual methods (bank withdraw is an abstraction)
		4. DON'T USE ITALICIZED (ABSTRACTION) UNLESS YOU MUST

Note: you could create a model with simple association and nothing else
	if you don't fully understand it, don't use it

Multiplicty
- the number of things that can be associated w/ each other
- /* means 0 or more
- say in the context of a classroom
	- classroom would have a number of 1
	- the student classes would have an /*

0..n means there is a limit (zero dot dot n)
/* means there is no limit
