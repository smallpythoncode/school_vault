Interface - anything the user is going to use to interact w/ the system
- monitors, touchscreen
- mobile device

The costs of software on a PC is greater than the hardware cost
- unless freeware???????
- typical for enterprise, i would say

Progress reports
- we will submit a statement on what has been done thus far
- working towards something
	- no cramming
- Agile
	- Sprints

Therac 25 was a tremendous fuck up
- did not account for variations in input latency
- the code was written by one person
	- there was no qc
	- inexperienced with the intended use (not a medical professional)
- user interface provided false information to the user

FAQs of software dev
- what are the costs
- what are the sd devs
- what is case (computer-aided software engineering)
- what are the attributes of good software
- what are the key challenges facing SD?

Rarely does SD start w/ a prototype
- compare this to manufacturing
- this in not ideal

Prototypes allow us to gauge the functionality intention w/ the customer
- limits wasted time

case tools
1. used to model of the software systems
2. computer aided design to help write the code
	1. object oriented - 280 w/ microsoft visual studio to model

staruml
- free educational version
- https://staruml.io/

we will code in c sharp
- visual studio widgets
	- drag and drop

What is software?
- writing code will eventually be like laying concrete
	- only skill set needed is laying concrete
- computer programs and associated documentation such as requirements, design models, and user manuals
- software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market

According to Grant, people will not be writing code - it will be written by machines
- it is up to us to tell exactly what the machines should be doing
- problem solving, not necessarily writing codes
