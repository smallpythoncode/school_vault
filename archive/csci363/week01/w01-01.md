This is a not a programming course
- sure, we'll do programming
- but it's not the main focus

Key Challenge
- What is the problem?
	- How do we define the problem?

This class will not be focused entirely on the keyboard

For physical buildings, things are set in concrete

For software, thing are not set in concrete, so bosses might say "let's change this"
- 90% complete, then someone suggest we change 50% of it
- We are trying to avoid this scenario

As developers of software, we have responsibility
- what we create has impact

Today's computer are ~100K more powerful than those used to put a man on the moon
- very few problems on the Apollo missions
- Now a days, there are numerous problems
	- Not understanding the nature of problem
		- How do we define both the problem and the solution in the form of code
		- very difficult given the increasing number of variables in the real world and unforeseen problems
	- Have we accounted for everything?
		- Miss one and it could lead to disaster
			- Mars rover was written in imperial when metric was intended

Don't tell the customer to change their process to fit the software
- Design software to fit the customers' desires

In C, it is possible to not use any variable names
- only write to memory locations

CONTEXT MATTERS

MIDTERM
- take-home exam
	- They claim to have tools to see if ChatGPT was used to written the statements
		- Don't utilize this wholesale
	- ChatGPT CAN BE WRONG
	- don't wait until the day it's due
		- Do that and you're going to have a bad time

Other assignments will come from the book

FINAL
- we have to work in teams
	- fuck......
- we are going develop the interface of a system
	- This is a simulation
	- only focused on the interface and user input
		- actual data is meaningless
		-
