Assignment 2 - Question 4

Task:
    Implement the lexical analyzer to handle the short program below. Write it
    in Python or in Java â€“ not in C because its codes are available in the
    textbook. Input file: a program below.

```

input(a)\n
input(b)\n
input(c)\n
total = a + b + c /* get a sum of three inputs */\n
average = total / 3 /* compute an average */\n
print(total)\n
print(average)\n

```

Notes:
    - It is assumed that there are newline characters at the end of each line.
    - Use of a proper lookup table mechanism (say, a dictionary) was decided
      against given the specific input file within assignment instructions.
      `LOOKUP_TABLE` in the below comment was used merely as a reference.
    - Lexemes absent from the input file specified in the assignment
      instructions were not accounted for (e.g., `-`, `%`, `>=`).
    - It is assumed identifiers start with an alphabetic character and contain
      only alphanumeric characters afterward.
    - It is assumed (based on input file specified in assignment instructions)
      will be used as lexemes for `<number>` tokens. Input of floating point
      numbers, negative numbers, and floating point numbers greater than negative
      one and less than one without a leading zero (e.g., '-.2', '.69') is
      possible, but not implemented in this program's version.
