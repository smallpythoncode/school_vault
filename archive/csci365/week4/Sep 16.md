# Assignment 1: Ch. 3
- Deals w EBNF
	- fuck
- 6, 7 focuses on axiomatic semantics
- we have to use graphing software i guess....

# Loop statement
Loop invariant and correctness of insertion-sort algo.
- Use a Loop invariant - a statement that always holds in the loop something something

Initialization - LI is true prior to the first iteration of the lop
Maintenance - If LI is true before an interation of the loop, then LI remains true if something something
Termination - something something

## Back around to axiomatic semantics
Loops

`This is definitely a hands on exercise. I'm learning dick by just watching her talk through slides`

- some error on slide 1-24
- refer here if necessary for s logical eq. 2 or s logical eq. 4

# Loop Invariant
- the loop invariant is a weakened version of the loop postcondition, and a precondition of the loop
- I must be weak enough to be satisfied prior to the beginning of the loop
- but when I is combined w/ the loop exit condition, it must be strong enough to force the truth of the post.
- The axiomatic description
