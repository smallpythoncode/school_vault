# Term project
summary of current geneology is already in the text book

## Phase 1
each member will need to decide what to do in the project
complete the graph and submit

at the end of class, we will have a perspective on the language class
- chapter 2 in text book

In phase 1, there is nothing new
- read the chapter and summarize essential features
- for each new node, could be a new language or a new version
	- new support
	- addition or deletion of features
	- describe these detail in the report

## Phase 2
explore new languages that have been developed since 2015
- those languages not in the graph

explore roughly 5 languages

## Phase 3
- explore languages not explored in the previous phases

## Templates
- available on BB
- instructions are included
- flow chart app listed in BB too
	- template included for the graph in the book

For a submission with multiple files
- include last name of both partners
- MUST BE ZIPPED

# Chapter 2
Evolution of Major Programming Lanugages

## Zuse's Plankalkul
Advanced data structures
- the single bit -> integer, floating point types
- iterative statements
Invariants
- mathematical expression that would be true during execution
Designed in 1945, but not published until 1972
- never implented

## Minimal Hardware Programming: pseudocodes
Difficulty of using machine code
- poor readability
- poor modifiability

### Short code
developed by Mauchly in 1949 for BINAC computers
- expression were coded, left to right
- (not that interesting, ngl)

### Speedcoding developed by Backus in 1954 for IBM 701-
- REMEMBER THE NAME BACKUS
- pseudo ops for arithmetic and math functions
- conditional and unconditional branching
- auto-increment registers for array access
- slow!
- only 700 words left for the user to program
- IBM was the gold standard for tech companies back in the day

### Related systems
UNIVAC
David J. Wheeler
- developed a method of using blocks of re-locatable addresses to solve the problem of absolute addressing

## IBM 704 and Fortran
Fortran 0: 1954 - not implemented
Fortran 1: 1957
- designed for the new IBM 704, which had index registers and floating-point hardware
- Utilized punch cards
- This led to the idea of compiled programming languages because there was no place the hide the cost of interpretation
### Design Process of Fortran
Impact of environment on the design
- no need for dynamic storage

### Fortran 1 Overview
- names could have up to six characters
- formatted i/o
- still widely used for some applications
- code was very fast

## Fortran IV
- explicit type declarations

## Fortran 77
Became the new standard in 1978
- characer string handling
- if, then, else statements

## Fortran 2003
- support for OOP

## Fortran 2023
- the latest version

## Lisp
- functional programming language
- developed to support AI
	- process data in lists (rather than arrays)
	- symbolic computation (rather than numeric)
- only two data types: atoms and lists
- syntax is based on lambda calculus

### Lisp evaluation
- pioneered functional programming
	- no need to vars. or assignment

### Scheme
- used for education of functional programming

## ALGOL 60
Environment for development
- fortran had (barely) arrived for IBM 70x
-  many other langs. were being developed, all for specific machines
- this one was designed to be used on any maching
New features
- block structure (local scope)
- two parameter passing methods
- subprogram recursion

### Evaluation
- not widely used in the US because of IBM
- first machine-independent language

## ALGOL 58
- concept of type was formalized
- names could be of any length

### Implementation
- not meant to be implemented
- IBM dropped support in favor of Fortran

## COBOL
- UNIVAC was beginning to use FLOW-MATIC
	- first english like data processing lang.
- USAF was beginning to use AIMACO
- IBM was developing COMTRAN
First design meeting
- Pentagon, May 1959
- Design goals
	- must look like simple English
	- easy to use
	- broaden the base of computer users
	- able to be used by all branches
- Heavy DoD influence
	- first lang required by DoD

## Basic
Design goals
- easy to learn and use for non-science students
- "pleasant and friendly"
- fast turnaround for homework
- free and private access
- user time is more important than computer time
Current popular dialect - Visual Basic

## PL/I
- scientific computing
- was initially an extension of Fortran IV
- initially called NPL (new programming language)
- first exception handling `kind of a big deal`

APL & SNOBOL
early dynamic languages
- characterized by dynamic typing and dynamic storage allocation
variables are untyped
- a var. requires a type when it is assigned a value - dynamic typing
storage is allocated to a var when it is assigned a value


## APL

## SNOBOL
designed for string manipulation and word processing
still used for certain tasks
