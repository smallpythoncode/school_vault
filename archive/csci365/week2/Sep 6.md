# APL and SNOBOL
- a variable acquires a type when it is assigned a value - dynamic typing

# SIMULA 67
designed primarily for system simulation
beginning of data asbstraction
Contributions
- coroutines - a kind of subprogram
- classes -> OOP

# ALGOL 68
source of several new ideas
Never widely used
designed is based on the concept of orthogonality
- a few basic concepts, plus a few combining mechanisms

## Evaluation
Comments
- less usage than ALGOL 60
Contributions
- reference types
- dynamic arrays
- user-defined data structures

# PASCAL - 1971
Designed for teaching structured programming
small, simple, nothing really new
largest impact was on teaching programming
- most widely used for teaching programming from mid-70s to lat 90s

# C - 1972
Designed for systems programming (Bell Labs, Dennis Richie)
Powerful set of operators, but poor type checking
Initially spread through UNIX

# Prolog
Based on formal logic
Non-procedural
Can be summarized as being an intelligent database system that uses an inferencing process to infer the truth of given queires
Comparatively inefficient
Few application areas

# Ada
- Huge design effort, involving hundreds of people, much money, and about eight years
- Designed for and used by DoD
- Named after Augusta Ada Byron, the first programmer
	- Computed the Bernoulli numbers

## Evaluation
### Contributions
Packages
Exception handling
Concurrency

### Comments
competitive design
First compilers were very difficult; the first really usable compiler came nearly five years after the language design was completed

Popularity suffered after the advent of C++
- not supported any more

# Smalltalk
- First pure OOP lang.
- pioneered GUI design

# C++
"C with classes"
- Evolved from SIMULA 67 and C
A large and complex lang., in part because it supports both procedural and OOP programming
MC++ (Microsoft C++)
- used .NET platform
Backward compatible w/ C, we few changes
- mostly possible to link C++ w/ c programs

# Swift
- Apple
- A replacement of objective-C
- Tuple data type, option type, protocol, generic type

# Delphi
- Began as an OOP version of Pascal: Object Pascal
- A hybrid lang., like C++

# Java
Imperative-based
- C, C++ were not satisfactory for embedded electronic devices
Based on C++
- smaller, simpler, more flexible, safer
- Only support OOP

## Evaluation
`thread`
- supports concurrency
Widely used for web programming
Portable: platform independent
Use increased faster than any previous lang.
!!!!!! RESEARCH Java 22 for project

# Perl
A scripting lang.
- Script: a list of commands in a file to be interpreted
- A lang. where instructions are written for a run-time environment

- Larry Wall, 1987
- Initially used as a UNIX utility
- compiled, sim. to imperative
- vars. are statically typed but implicitly declared
- dynamic length array
- powerful, but somewhat dangerous
- gained widespread use for CGI programming on the Web
	- Common Gateway Interface - dynamic webpage content generation

# Javascript
- Began at Netscape, but later became a joint venture of Netscape and Joint Micro.
- client-side HTML-embedded scripting lang.
	- HTML 5 is modern standard
- Purely interpretted
- Related to Java only through similar syntax

# PHP
Hypertext Preprocessor
- purely interpreted
- Server-side

# Web languages
HTML
CSS
- styling
JavaScript
- pg. 95 textbook

# Python
- OOP
- type-checked but dynamically typed
- Google's lang. of choice

# Ruby
- began as a replacement for Perl and Python
- A pure object-oriented scripting lang
	- all data are objects
- Most operators are implemented as methods, which can be redefined by user code
- purely interpreted

# Server-Side and Platform
Node.js
ASP.NET
Ruby on Rails

# C sharp
- .NET platform
